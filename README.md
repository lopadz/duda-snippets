# Code Snippets for Duda sites
A collection of CSS styles and JS scripts you can add to your own projects as needed.

## Categories
Divided into different 2 main categories: **CSS** and **JS**. Subcategories:

- Typography: Outlined text, lines before text, spacing, etc.
- Layout: Columns, positioning, media queries, etc.
- FX: Hover states, animations, etc.

## Implementation

### CSS
Each snippet is tagged with **inline** or **global** types.

- **Inline**: Add the snippet to the widget's CSS (right-click > "Edit HTML/CSS")
- **Global**: Add the snippet to site.css (Dev Mode > Site HTML/CSS > site.css). Then, simply add the class to any widget that needs it.
